    question: "Why should I outsource my outreach?",

      "It depends on your needs; both approaches have merits. Hiring in house can be expensive, not to mention that you have to train and onboard them which can take a ton of time.",

    question: "My Email Campaigns Get Low Reply Rates. Can You Help me?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Our system improves reply rates by 2.4x on average through targeted leads, optimized infrastructure, and high-converting copy.",

    question: "Why Should I Choose Your Agency And Not An AI SDR Company That Does Everything For Me?",
    answer:
      "AI SDR companies may look appealing, but they can't compete with us in lead listing, copywriting, and infrastructure setupâ€”the pillars of a successful campaign.",
